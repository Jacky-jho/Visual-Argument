# Visual-Argument

This project is the design repository of a Pro-Nuclear Energy poster

In the current global focus of mitigating climate change and moving on to clean energy, nuclear power could play such a big role in replacing so many sources of dirty-energy with very little downsides. However, the general public is still traumatized by the tragedies of Chernobyl, Fukushima and the Three-Mile-Island reactor meltdowns that they refuse to research/read about nuclear power in-depth, because if they did, they could realize how safe nuclear power has become and how the prior meltdowns were very preventable, even more so with modern advancements in technology.

My goal wouldn't be to change the opinion of someone on the spot, on the street but instead to sow the seeds of doubt about their own perception of nuclear power being unsafe. If I were to design a graphic that does this in the short attention span that it takes for someone to glance at a poster on the street, I would need to employ flashy graphics to draw their attention and then condense a lot of information into only the most important ones that have the potential to deliver said "seeds of doubt" onto viewers.
