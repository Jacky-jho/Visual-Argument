# Visual-Argument

This project is the design repository of a Pro-Nuclear Energy poster

In the current global focus of mitigating climate change and moving on to clean energy, nuclear power could play such a big role in replacing so many sources of dirty-energy with very little downsides. However, the general public is still traumatized by the tragedies of Chernobyl, Fukushima and the Three-Mile-Island reactor meltdowns that they refuse to research/read about nuclear power in-depth, because if they did, they could realize how safe nuclear power has become in addition to their advantages over the popular green energy alternatives.

This specific poster is designed to compare the equivalent energy output of 1 nuclear power plant to 8 million solar panels. The poster will display a list of statistics that explain why solar power farms can inefficient compared to 1 nuclear power plant. It will also provide some general information about nuclear power to entice readers to research more on their own, given that I want to minimize the amount of information displayed in the poster as to not overwhelm viewers.
The poster features the visual graphic of 1 nuclear power plant placed next to an endless field of solar panels to drive the point further of how 1 nuclear power plant is more space-efficient than 8 million solar panels.
